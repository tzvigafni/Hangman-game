Hangman game

the progress of the game:
The player needs to enter (1) a path to a word file and (2) a position (index) for a word in the file.
In accordance with the input from the player, the secret word for the game will be selected.
The player will be shown the appropriate state of the hanging man based on his number of failed attempts.
At the beginning of the game, the opening state (the first of the seven states, i.e.
the horizontal line of the rack) will be displayed.
Below the hanging man,
the secret word will be presented to the player in the structure of underscores (with spaces).
The player has to input one character each round.
If the character is not correct (two characters or more and/or is not an English letter,
or it was guessed before), an "X" will be printed to the screen,
and the list of letters that have already been guessed in the past will be printed (as a string of lowercase letters,
sorted from lower to upper and separated by arrows) the player will enter another character until Confirm that the
character to be typed will be correct.
After each correct guess, the secret word will be presented to the player in the structure of underscores (even if he
guessed partially or has not yet been able to guess at all).
In case of a failed guess - the output will be printed :( and below it will be printed a picture of the hanging man
in a more "advanced" state.

End of the game:
If the player guessed the whole word correctly - WIN will be printed to the screen.
If the player guessed six failed attempts - LOSE will be printed to the screen.
